Arguments that challenge a deeply ingrained assumption or narrative by introducing an unexpected, yet plausible alternative explanation are more persuasive.

Arguments that clarify the distinction between key concepts (e.g., motive vs. intent) can significantly influence a person's perspective, leading to a fundamental shift in their understanding of an issue.

Arguments that acknowledge and address the inherent unfairness of economic systems, where those who already have a significant amount of wealth or power tend to accumulate even more at the expense of others, can significantly influence a person's perspective on taxation policies. This understanding can lead individuals to support progressive taxation as a means to mitigate these inequalities and promote a more just society.

In this context, taxing individual wealthy people rather than corporations allows for a more targeted approach to addressing wealth inequality. By acknowledging that those who have already accumulated significant wealth often have the means to take advantage of loopholes and deductions, targeting individuals can help ensure that they are not able to exploit these systems to further accumulate wealth at the expense of others.

This hypothesis recognizes that economic systems can be inherently unfair, and that progressive taxation is a means to address this issue. By acknowledging the role of individual agency in perpetuating or mitigating these inequalities, this hypothesis provides a more nuanced understanding of the motivations behind support for progressive taxation policies.
